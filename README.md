Toggle Directory
================

This script is for switching the visibility of a directory by renaming it.
E.g. ```toggle my_folder``` will rename ```my_folder``` to ```.my_folder``` and back with another call.

## Installation

Put the script file in ```/usr/bin``` and give it execution rights.

 ```
 sudo cp toggle /usr/bin/toggle
 sudo chmod a+rx /usr/bin/toggle
 ```

Now you can toggle directories via ```toggle DIRNAME```.
